# Simply Splendid Boilerplate

This boilerplate project will be the starting point for other apps.

The /db and /ui folders contain the database and user interface projects respectively. Most of the logic resides in the /ui project (nextjs project that contains some API endpoints as well).

Refer to the /db and /ui sub folder repos for more information.

Running locally

Run `docker-compose up` to start the Postgres container and the ui.
